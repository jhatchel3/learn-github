            <p>
              My name is James Hatchel III. I was born in South Carolina but
              raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As of now I live in Dallas, Texas.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my software engineering journey studying SQL. Next I
              went on to study Java for six months before focusing on front end
              development. My self study prepared me for my journey with
              Thinkful which has been challenging and rewarding.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am passionate about developing web sites that help people make
              sense out of all the information on the world wide web. Once upon
              a time only the few had the information they needed in order to
              live the lives they desired. Now, it seems that there is so much
              information that it is easy to be caught in a state of constant
              information consumption and never elevate to application of
              knowledge.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My journey to software development is different than most. Growing
              up I never had an interest in computers. I always leaned towards
              more physical exploits; mainly bodybuidling. From the age of
              thirteen until the age thirty-two my obession was bodybuilding.
              With that obession I decided to get a bachelors degree in
              Kinesiology. Upon graduation I landed my dream job; selling
              personal training at LA Fitness in Atlanta, Georgia. After a
              couple years I became bored with fitness because I felt like I had
              basically learned everything, and all the new information was
              basically just a deviation from what already was an optimal way to
              achieve any fitness goal.
            </p>

            <p>
              One day I had a great idea for a web site that had a catalog of
              fitness videos that people could subscribe to. I searched far and
              wide for a developer that would take on the project and everyone I
              spoke with had no idea how to develop it. Now I know that the
              people I was contacting where merely front end developers which is
              not a bad thing but that is just to say that they had little to no
              experience in developing full stack applications. After about 6
              months of trying to find someone else to develop the project, I
              decided I would learn how to do it myself. It has been a long road
              and I am excited about the ability to help millions of peole with
              software that I have developed.
            </p>

            <p>
              A wise man once said "If you want to fast, go alone; if you want
              to go far go together". What makes software development so amazing
              to me is that you will never know everything. Working with a team
              of fellow engineers is my ultimate goal. I want to go to work
              everyday and work on challenging portions of a project with a team
              of individuals. Working with a team will allow us all to learn
              from each other, see other points of view and grow as a company
              and individuals. I have spent the last three years of my
              professional career as the manager of a restaurant. During this
              time I have truly realized the value of a cohesive team. I know a
              team is only as strong as its weakest link but also with the right
              mindset can accomplish anything.
            </p>

            <p>
              My services include front end web development using HTML5/CSS3. I
              also can provide full stack software development using Javascript
              and Node. I also can offer expertise in libraries such as Node
              Express and Boostrap. With my extensive study of relational
              databases I will be able to use your market research and turn that
              data into a viable software solution for your customers.

                    exciting for the both of them can act as an ice breaker. If
                    a couple has been in a relationship for a years then
                    something new is exactly what it takes to create new
